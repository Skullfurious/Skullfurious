## Hello, I'm Skullfurious. 

#### Programmer / Artist

I have experience working with C++, JS, Python, Lua, and more. I don't necessarily know everything about each one at all times since I'm switching frequently I'm able to quickly switch between different languages and pick up on a project's code style and the languages syntax very quickly.

If you like what I'm working on feel free to give me advice I'm always open to learning new things. See you out there!
