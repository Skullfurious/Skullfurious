## Hello, I'm Skullfurious. 

#### Programmer / Artist

I have experience working with C++, JS, Python, Lua, and more. I don't necessarily know everything about each language I've worked with at all times since I'm switching frequently however I'm able to quickly switch between different languages and pick up on a project's code style and the languages syntax.

If you like what I'm working on feel free to give me advice I'm always open to learning new things even if it was a while back! 

See you out there!
